Explore Data in SQL Lab
---------------

With the basic skills of using Superset now firmly in your hands, let’s dive a little deeper into SQL Lab in this last part of this Installation guide, so you can explore data with ease in Superset. 

The SQL Lab menu in has 3 options:

SQL Editor: interactive and intelligent SQL IDE with schema navigation and autocomplete features. Support for long-running queries, celery Queues

Saved Queries : Searchable list of saved queries from the SQL Editor screen.
Query Search : Searchable list of queries executed in SQL Editor, saved or not saved.


Let’s look at each of these options with visual guides.

Hopefully this Installation guide was a breeze to complete and gave you enough knowledge to get some immediate value out of Superset. (And your data!) If you find any issues, please file an issue or PR to propose a fix or edit. 

As for what’s next, we recommend you explore the Datasource Connectors section to connect your Superset to your existing database solutions and check out the Build Your Own Viz Plugins section to add your own chart plugin! 

Superset is designed to be easily customizable and extendable.
