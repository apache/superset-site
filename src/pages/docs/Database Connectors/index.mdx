AWS Athena
-------------

The connection string for Amazon Athena is as follows:

```
awsathena+jdbc://{aws_access_key_id}:{aws_secret_access_key}@athena.{region_name}.amazonaws.com/{schema_name}?s3_staging_dir={s3_staging_dir}&...
```
Where you need to escape/encode at least the s3_staging_dir, i.e.,
```
s3://... -> s3%3A//...
```
You can also use PyAthena library (no java required) as follows:

```
awsathena+rest://{aws_access_key_id}:{aws_secret_access_key}@athena.{region_name}.amazonaws.com/{
```
