Apache Drill
-------------

At the time of writing, the SQLAlchemy dialect is not available on PYPI and must be downloaded from SQLAlchemy Drill

Alternatively, you can install it completely from the command line as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/JohnOmernik/sqlalchemy-drill
cd sqlalchemy-drill
python3 setup.py install
```

Once that is done, you can connect to Drill in two ways, either via the REST interface or by JDBC. If you are connecting via JDBC, you must have the Drill JDBC Driver installed.

The basic connection string for Drill looks like this:

```
drill+sadrill://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{storage_plugin}?use_ssl=True
```

If you are using JDBC to connect to Drill, the connection string looks like this:

```
drill+jdbc://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{storage_plugin}
```
